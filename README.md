### ðŸ”¬ About
Research focuses on **ignition mechanisms**, **heat transfer**, and **thermal decomposition** of wildland fuels under controlled and applied fire environments.  
Work involves both **experimental characterization** and **modeling**-from **thermal radiation studies in cone calorimeter tests** to **numerical simulations and analytical formulations** describing fuel heating and ignition behavior.
